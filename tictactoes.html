        <P>
            When learning a new language, I often try to code a simple Tic Tac Toe game, as it teaches a variety of skills (lists, conditionality, simple UI design).
            All of my implementations can be found at the repository above, along with brief explanations below:

        <h3>.NET Framework Implementation - <a href="https://github.com/Sean-Stilwell/Tic-Tac-Toes/tree/master/C%23_NET_Implementation">GitHub</a></h3>
        <P>
            This version was created on Visual Studio 2019 using standard Windows Form Applications from the .NET Framework, it is coded in C#. This version uses a MVC 
            methodology, with a Board class modelling the Tic Tac Toe game, a visual display of the model, and a controller class to run the game.

        <h3>Java Implementation - <a href="https://github.com/Sean-Stilwell/Tic-Tac-Toes/tree/master/Java_Basic_Implementation">GitHub</a></h3>
        <P>
            This is a very simplistic text-based version of Tic Tac Toe, coded in Java. It was originally created prior to my Intro to Computing II class, so I could
            learn basic Java before starting. This implementation was also used as an outline for the C# implementation, and is also used in the Android application.
