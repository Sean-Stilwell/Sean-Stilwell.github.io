        <P>
            When learning a new language, I often try to code a simple Tic Tac Toe game, as it teaches a variety of skills (lists, conditionality, simple UI design).
            All of my implementations can be found at the repository above, along with brief explanations below:

        <a href="https://github.com/Sean-Stilwell/Tic-Tac-Toes/tree/master/Android_TicTacToe"><h3>Android Implementation - <img src="images/github.png" height="20" width="20" title="GitHub" alt="GitHub"></a></h3>
        <P>
            This is an Android version of Tic Tac Toe, coded in Java. I created this as additional practice using Android Studio for mobile application development,
            as well as to utilize a basic model I had previously made for Java Tic Tac Toe games.

        <P>
            This version was created on Unity Pro and is coded in C#. I created this to teach myself how to use Unity for 2D game design, as well as to perfect the
            C# version I created in my .NET implementation.

        <P>
            This version was created on Visual Studio 2019 using standard Windows Form Applications from the .NET Framework, it is coded in C#. This version uses a MVC 
            methodology, with a Board class modelling the Tic Tac Toe game, a visual display of the model, and a controller class to run the game.

            This is a text-based version of Tic Tac Toe, coded in Python. It was originally created as part of my Intro to Computing I class for Professor Diana Inkpen. This
            served as the basis for the Java version.

        <P>
            This is another simple text-based version of Tic Tac Toe, albeit very different from the Python or Java implementations. This uses the functional programming paradigm
            and is coded in Racket/Scheme, which heavily uses recursion.
