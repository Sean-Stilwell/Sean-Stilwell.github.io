                This is an Android application coded in Java that allows users to interact with a clinic. This project was completed as part of my Introduction to Software Engineering (SEG2505) under Professor Miguel Garzon. We were required 
                to use GitHub Classroom for this task, therefore I cannot provide a link to the repository.

            <div class="paragraph">
                This app was completed in four deliverables. In the first, we had to provide the ability to create a Patient or Staff account. Account details are stored using a Firebase database. Additionally, there had to
                 be an administrator account that can manage the clinic within the app.
            </div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">
                During the second deliverable, we had to provide administrator functionality. An administrator account is able to add, edit, or remove the services that the clinic offers, as well as remove staff or patients 
                from the system.
            </div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">
                For the third deliverable, we had to provide employee functionality. An employee could edit their profile, such as their basic information (email, phone number, etc), the services that they provide within the clinic, 
                and the hours that they are working.
            </div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">
                For the fourth (and final) deliverable, we had to provide patient functionality. Patients can search for available staff for a requested service. They can view the available time slots and make bookings with the 
                staff member. They can also view the approximate waiting time for walk-in service.
            </div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">
                Throughout the project, we were responsible for writing effective documentation, such as UML diagrams, which meant our software could be easily used and eventually modified by a future programmer. Additionally, we were 
                responsible for writing effective test cases that would be automatically run, as well as implementing CircleCI with the project.
