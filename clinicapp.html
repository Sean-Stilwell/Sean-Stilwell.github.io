            This mobile application allows administrators, employees, and patients at the uOttawa Clinic to conduct all interactions with the clinic. (Note: this 
            app was made for a Software Engineering class and is not the official application)
        </P>
        <P>
            This application was developed in a group for Android using Android Studio, and was coded in Java. The database uses Firebase, the built-in database
            system recommended for Android Studio. This project was performed using an Agile methodology, with the final project consisting of four distinct deliverables.
        </P>
        <h3>Features:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Employees and Patients can create secure accounts with encryption protecting their passwords.</li>
            <li>Employees can manage the services they offer, as well as their availability times each day.</li>
            <li>Patients can search for services based on availability or popularity.</li>
            <li>Patients can make appointments with employees and then evaluate their experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <P>
            Each deliverable brought new functionality to the app. The first brought account creation and logging in, the second brought administrator functionality, 
            the third brought employee functionality, and the final brought patient functionality. We created UML models to plan our work, developed them, and created 
            unit test to ensure proper functionality.
        </P>
        <P>
            A final report was also submitted, which provides additional information about the app, and can be found <a href="files/Rapport - Projet final SEG2505.pdf">here</a>.
