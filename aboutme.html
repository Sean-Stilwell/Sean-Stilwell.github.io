            <h2>About Me!</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Hi! My name is Sean Stilwell. I'm a third-year Computer Science student at the University of Ottawa with experience in a variety of languages and technologies
                 and several years of development experience. 
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                I've been programming for around five years and have built numerous projects over that time. Some examples of my work are the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.game.lightsout&pcampaignid=pcampaignidMKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1">Lights Out!</a> 
                mobile game, which has been downloaded several hundred times, as well as developing a <a href="file:///F:/Users/Sean%20Stilwell/Documents/Programming/Sean-Stilwell.github.io/clinicapp.html">mobile application for a fictional clinic</a> 
                and a <a href="https://github.com/Sean-Stilwell/competitionapp">competition management website</a>. More information about these projects (and others!) can be found on my <a href="file:///F:/Users/Sean%20Stilwell/Documents/Programming/Sean-Stilwell.github.io/projects.html">Projects</a> page.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                I'm fluently bilingual, having attained my DELF B2 certification from the Ministry of Education of France, as well as passing the Second Language Certification
                Test at the University of Ottawa. I previously worked as the Marketing and Communications lead for the Google Developer Student Club at uOttawa.
