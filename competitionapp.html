            This web application allows corporate partners to manage athletic competitions, as well as athletes participating in them, and their results. This application 
            was created as part of the Databases I class at uOttawa by Professor Andrew Forward.
        </P>
        <P>
            The application is a fairly simple website, using HTML5 and CSS styling. It uses a PostgreSQL database to store user accounts, which is facilitated using PHP to 
            display and insert data. It was produced using an Agile methodology, consisting of four deliverables throughout the semester.
        </P>
        <h3>Features:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Public users can view all of the competitions, the events in each competition, and the athlete results for each event.</li>
            <li>Corporate partners can create an account and host competitions, manage athletes, and their results.</li>
            <li>Competitions can include an unlimited number of events. Each event is scored in a specified way (for example, by time or by repetitions).</li>
            <li>Partners can create athletes and register them for their competitions. They can also edit or add results for the events.</li>
        </ul>
        <P>
            Deliverables brought new aspects to the product. The first deliverable added athletes and competitions, the second brought partner accounts and the ability to register 
            athletes for competitions, the third introduced results functionality and the ability to change results, while the final deliverable brought improved UI and the ability 
            to view competitions and their results.
