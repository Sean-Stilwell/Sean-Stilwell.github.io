            <P>
                Hi! My name is Sean Stilwell and I'm a third-year Computer Science student at the University of Ottawa. I'm an aspiring developer, with work experience
                ranging from project planning to quality assurance through the CO-OP Program.
            </P>
            <P>
                I've been programming for about 5 years, and I'm proficient in a variety of languages. I have experience creating applications in C#, Java, and Python, and 
                have also learned concurrent, logical, and functional programming using Golang, Prolog, and Racket respectively. I'm also experienced with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
                and PHP for web design, and SQL-based languages for databases.
            </P>
            <P>
                I'm fluently bilingual, having attained my DELF B2 certification from the Ministry of Education of France, as well as passing the Second Language Certification
                Test at the University of Ottawa. I'm passionate about promoting bilingualism, especially for Canadian youth!
            </P>
