            <P>
                Hi! My name is Sean Stilwell and I'm a third-year Computer Science student at the University of Ottawa. I'm an aspiring developer, with work experience
                ranging from project planning to quality assurance through the CO-OP Program.
            </P>
            <P>
                I've been programming for about 5 years, and I'm proficient in a variety of languages. I have experience creating applications in C#, Java, and Python, and 
                have also learned concurrent, logical, and functional programming using Golang, Prolog, and Racket respectively. I'm also experienced with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
                and PHP for web design, and SQL-based languages for databases.
            </P>
            <P>
                I'm fluently bilingual, having attained my DELF B2 certification from the Ministry of Education of France, as well as passing the Second Language Certification
                Test at the University of Ottawa. I'm passionate about promoting bilingualism, especially for Canadian youth!

            <P>
                I've completed many projects for both academic and personal reasons. Below is a showcase of some of my work, along with links to the GitHub repos for personal
                projects.
            </P>

            <h3>MeFit Competition Management Web Application <a href="https://youtu.be/QqUx5usQNmk">(Video Demo)</a></h3>
            <P>
                This web application allows corporate partners to manage their competitions quickly and effectively. Partners can create competitions, which contain a series
                of events, and then add athletes and their results to the system. A PostgreSQL database holds all data, facilitated by PHP to display and retrieve information.
            </P>
            <P>
                This project was completed as part of my Databases I class and received a mark of 97%.
            </P>

            <h3>Clinic Management Android Application <a href="files/Rapport - Projet final SEG2505.pdf">(French Documentation)</a></h3>
            <P>
                This mobile application allows administrators, employees, and patients at clinics to conduct all interactions with the clinic. Employees can set their hours
                and services provided, while patients can make appointments and search available doctors. A Firebase database is used for the data, and the program is written in Java.
            </P>

                This group project was completed for an Introduction to Software Engineering class and received a mark of 91%.
